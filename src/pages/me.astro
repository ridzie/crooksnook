		i am Ridzie. I am *redacted* years old and live in *redacted*. I enjoy a little art, a little science, a little bullshit, participating in a lot of very poorly acted out over the top dramas, and satire. I’m very poor at comebacks. I think Animal Farm is a fun read that makes me smile at absurdity, and 1987 is still my favourite book. I have two cats called gremlin children, and watching the world burn with me in it is a regular pastime for me.

		I’m a software engineer, and I work on a lot of different things. I’m currently working on a project that involves building a web application using Astro, which is a static site generator. I’m also working on a few other projects that involve building web applications using React and Vue.
